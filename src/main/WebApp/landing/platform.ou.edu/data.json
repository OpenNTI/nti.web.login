It is the integration of each of these elements that allows for the human body to function as a whole to accomplish particular tasks. In this course, we will focus on how the human body works through the activities of interconnected organ systems. We will begin by reviewing fundamental concepts from related fields of study including Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology. We will then build upon those concepts as we explore each of the organ systems, their interconnectivity and the effects that specific perturbations will have on those organ systems and subsequent ability to maintain homeostasis. Students will also apply their physiology knowledge to information they encounter on the Internet, in magazines, and on television. Students will complete this course using online resources including lecture videos, animations, workbooks, and discussions, followed by in-class activities that are designed to reinforce online activities and to promote critical thinking skills via case studies and clinical applications. The laboratory session will give students an appreciation of human physiology by conducting hands-on experiments that deal with principles discussed online and in-class.",

The focus of this course is on law, because law is the meeting point between the theory and practice of justice. With  Aristotle's Politics as our principal guide, we will participate in an ancient and enduring conversation about the nature of law and justice.",

		"description": "Elementary Business Statistics is the first level statistics class required for all Business and Economics majors and can be used to satisfy the statistics requirement in other departments if you are enrolled as a for-credit OU-student. It is designed as an introductory course to statistics theory and methodology. The foundation of statistical inference is first developed through coverage of descriptive statistics and then close coverage of probability theory and probability density functions: specifically the binomial, Poisson, geometric, and normal distributions. The leap from probability theory to actual inferential statistics by way of the Central Limit Theory is accomplished with the use of a gaming model in which students actively participate to solve a constrained goals a constrained goal that requires an understanding of the link between the Central Limit Theorem and the sample size. Confidence internals and Hypothesis testing follow with careful development of both the theory and philosophy of the hypothesis test. Specific hypotheses are covered including test for means, proportions, differences in mean and differences in proportions, and for variances. Finally correlations and regression are covered in detail. The foundation OLS model is developed and students will be able to propose and test various hypotheses concerning a causal relationship assumed to be linear. For credit Oklahoma University students will have the opportunity to interact with face2face teaching assistants once per week in regularly scheduled lab classes.",

We will discuss a number of executive, moral, intellectual, and civic virtues and their related vices, and will address some of the fundamental philosophical questions that arise in the study of virtue ethics: What is a virtue? How is virtue related to a life that is good for the individual and good for the community? Can virtue be taught? Can virtue be measured? Are we suspicious of virtue? What are the grounds for critique of some of the traditional virtues?",
