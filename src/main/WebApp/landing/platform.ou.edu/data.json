The course features a graphic novel that chronicles the tales of Atlas Black as he works to fund his college expenses, start a new business, and act as a fledgling entrepreneur, along the way illustrating key concepts from principles of management. Recent studies conducted at OU find graphic novels are associated with superior student recall compared to traditional textbooks alone. The content of the course will use innovative delivery material including online lectures, a traditional textbook, and a graphic novel textbook, as well as a specific emphasis on businesses in the state of Oklahoma.",
