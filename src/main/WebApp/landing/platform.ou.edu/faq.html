			<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>

			<h5>What is Janux?</h5>
			<p>
				Created by the University of Oklahoma (OU), Janux is
				an online interactive learning community that gives
				students direct connections to courses, educational
				resources, faculty, and each other. Janux courses are
				freely available or may be taken for college credit
				for enrolled OU students. We believe students learn
				best when interacting in meaningful ways with other
				learners vs. working alone in a course. Janux is
				designed to connect people while they learn from top
				OU faculty and content.
			</p>

			<h5>Who created the Janux courses?</h5>
			<p>
				All Janux courses are developed by faculty at the
				University of Oklahoma, with pedagogical and
				instructional design support from
				OU&rsquo;s <a href="http://teach.ou.edu">Center for Teaching
				Excellence</a>. Janux is a part
				of <a href="http://www.ou.edu/oneuniversity">One
				University</a>, a university-wide digital initiative,
				utilizing technology and digital content to enhance
				the student experience.
			</p>

			<h5>What technology does Janux use?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux is built on the NextThought platform. Learn more
				about the
				technology <a href="http://nextthought.com/">here</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>Who can take a Janux course? How do I sign up?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux courses are available to anyone! OU students
				sign up by entering their OU 4+4 or create a free
				account <a href="https://janux.ou.edu/login/signup.html">here</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>How much do courses cost?</h5>
			<p>
				There is no charge to access Janux courses in a
				non-credit environment. If you are interested in
				college credit, OU students
				and <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/nondegree.html">Special
				Students</a> can enroll in a for-credit version at
				normal OU tuition costs.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I earn college credit?</h5>
			<p>
				Yes. Non-OU students interested in credit can learn
				more about becoming
				a <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/nondegree.html">Special
				Student</a>. OU students can enroll on oZone to earn
				credit. Note: While some courses are fully online,
				others have face-to-face components that meet
				regularly on campus.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I just audit a course?</h5>
			<p>
				Feel free to come and go throughout a course as you
				please. No harm, no foul. But we believe the maximum
				value comes from immersing yourself in the full course
				experience from beginning to end.
			</p>


			<h3>COURSES</h3>

			<h5>How do I access a course?</h5>
			<p>
				To access a course, navigate to your Library and
				select &ldquo;Current and Upcoming&rdquo; for ongoing classes or
				&ldquo;Archived&rdquo; for classes from the previous semester or
				later. Books may also be accessible by selecting &ldquo;Your
				Books&rdquo; from the dropdown menu on the left side of the
				page.

			</p>

			<h5>When do courses start and how long do they run?</h5>
			<p>
				All of the course start dates and duration are located
				on that course&rsquo;s specific info page located on the
				Janux homepage and inside the platform. Janux courses
				run in parallel with actual OU courses and tend to
				last 16 weeks (the length of a traditional academic
				semester).
			</p>

			<h5>Do courses have prerequisites?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux courses range all the way from entry to graduate
				level and thus sometimes recommend specific
				prerequisites. All information regarding prerequisites
				can be found on the course&rsquo;s specific course page
				located on the Janux homepage and inside the platform.
				If you are not interested in earning credit, you are
				not required to submit any proof of prior knowledge.
			</p>

			<h5>Do I need to be available for live video lectures?</h5>
			<p>
				All videos are asynchronous so you can interact on
				your schedule.
			</p>

			<h5>In what time zone do courses take place?</h5>
			<p>
				All course deadlines are in Central Standard Time
				(CST). Example: Quiz 1 is due Monday at midnight CST,
				or Tuesday 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).
			</p>

			<h5>Will courses be offered more than once?</h5>
			<p>
				Yes. We plan to offer most of the courses again in
				future semesters.
			</p>

			<h5>Are the videos captioned or transcribed?</h5>
			<p>
				All videos should have full transcriptions. Learn more
				about the &ldquo;Play With Transcript&rdquo; feature below.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I access a course if it has already started?</h5>
			<p>
				All courses can be accessed at any point during the
				courses duration. You can also access previous courses
				in the Archive section of the library.
			</p>

			<h5>Do I lose all my work at the end of the course?</h5>
			<p>
				No. As long as you have an active account, you will
				have access to all of the course materials as well as
				your notes.
			</p>

			<h5>What if I cannot finish my course?</h5>
			<p>
				There is no penalty for not completing a course. Feel
				free to come back to the course when you can. While it
				may not be running live, you will still have access to
				the course and its materials.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I remove a course from My Courses?</h5>
			<p>
				In the Library, hover over a course tile and click the
				gear icon in the right corner. Select &ldquo;Drop Course&rdquo; in
				the subsequent text boxes, and save your changes by
				selecting &ldquo;Finished.&rdquo;
			</p>



			<h3>FEATURES</h3>

			<h5>How do I make a note or highlight my text?</h5>
			<p>
				Drag your cursor over the desired passage, and a
				toolbar with blue, green, and yellow circles and a
				speech bubble icon will appear. Choose a color for
				your highlighted text and you&rsquo;re done.
			<br><br>
				To make a note in text, repeat the aforementioned
				steps and select the speech bubble icon. Edit your
				title, body text, sharing and privacy settings and
				click &ldquo;Save.&rdquo; You can also create notes by clicking on
				the speech bubble icon that appears to the right of
				text on the platform, or to the right of transcripts
				if you are in the Media Viewer.
			</p>


			<h5>How can I share a note?</h5>
			<p>
				When creating a note, you have the option to make it
				&ldquo;Public&rdquo; or &ldquo;Private.&rdquo; Additionally you can tag
				individual contacts and groups in the field marked
				&ldquo;Add people to this discussion.&rdquo; You can also change
				the sharing once a note has been created by opening
				the note, and clicking &ldquo;Share.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<h5>Can everyone see the post I just made?</h5>
			<p>
				You control who is able to see your note: what you
				want, with whom you want, and when you want. Public
				notes can be viewed by everyone who has signed up for
				the course, both OU students and individuals not
				taking it for credit. If you want to keep your note to
				yourself or a limited audience, set the sharing to
				&ldquo;Private&rdquo; when creating the note and then tag any
				desired contacts or groups in the note.
			</p>

			<h5>How can I see the video transcripts?</h5>
			<p>
				If a video transcript is available, an icon is
				displayed to the right of the video title on the
				overview page. Clicking on that icon takes you into
				the Media Viewer, where the transcript is available.
				To change the appearance of the transcript on your
				screen, select a preference from the menu at the top
				of the Media Viewer page.

				are tied to you individually. Navigate to your profile
				by clicking your image located in the top right-hand
				corner of the browser and click &ldquo;Thoughts.&rdquo; Thoughts
				can be shared the same way as notes. View other
				contacts&rsquo; Thoughts by navigating to their profiles.
			</p>

				and illustrate concepts. When creating a note, adding
				a comment, or chatting with a contact, click the

				an indicator on their &ldquo;Chat&rdquo; icon.

			<p>
				You can search everything at once, including notes,
				content, transcripts, and more. Click the Search tab
				at the top of your browser and begin typing your
				search query. Results are sorted by type. Click &ldquo;Show
				more...&rdquo; to display more of that type of result. You
				can filter results by using the drop-down menu located
				on the right-hand side of the search entry field.
				Note: Janux searches for only the content located in
				the course you&rsquo;re currently viewing.

				Navigate to the Recent Activity tab and select &ldquo;Only
				Me&rdquo; from the dropdown menu at the bottom of the
				window.

				Question as many times as you like. Results are
