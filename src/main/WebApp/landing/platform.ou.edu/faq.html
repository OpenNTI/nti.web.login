			<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>

			<h5>What is Janux?</h5>
			<p>
				Created by the University of Oklahoma (OU), Janux is
				an online interactive learning community that gives
				students direct connections to courses, educational
				resources, faculty, and each other. Janux courses are
				freely available or may be taken for college credit
				for enrolled OU students. We believe students learn
				best when interacting in meaningful ways with other
				learners vs. working alone in a course. Janux is
				designed to connect people while they learn from top
				OU faculty and content.
			</p>

			<h5>Who created the Janux courses?</h5>
			<p>
				All Janux courses are developed by faculty at the
				University of Oklahoma, with pedagogical and
				instructional design support from
				OU’s <a href="http://teach.ou.edu">Center for Teaching
				Excellence</a>. Janux is a part
				of <a href="http://www.ou.edu/oneuniversity">One
				University</a>, a university-wide digital initiative,
				utilizing technology and digital content to enhance
				the student experience.
			</p>

			<h5>What technology does Janux use?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux is built on the NextThought platform. Learn more
				about the
				technology <a href="http://nextthought.com/">here</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>Who can take a Janux course? How do I sign up?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux courses are available to anyone! OU students
				sign up by entering their OU 4+4 or create a free
				account <a href="https://janux.ou.edu/login/signup.html">here</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>How much do courses cost?</h5>
			<p>
				There is no charge to access Janux courses in a
				non-credit environment. If you are interested in
				college credit, OU students
				and <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/nondegree.html">Special
				Students</a> can enroll in a for-credit version at
				normal OU tuition costs.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I earn college credit?</h5>
			<p>
				Yes. Non-OU students interested in credit can learn
				more about becoming
				a <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/nondegree.html">Special
				Student</a>. OU students can enroll on oZone to earn
				credit. Note: While some courses are fully online,
				others have face-to-face components that meet
				regularly on campus.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I just audit a course?</h5>
			<p>
				Feel free to come and go throughout a course as you
				please. No harm, no foul. But we believe the maximum
				value comes from immersing yourself in the full course
				experience from beginning to end.
			</p>


			<h3>COURSES</h3>

			<h5>How do I access a course?</h5>
			<p>
				The library, accessible through the top toolbar,
				contains all courses and books to which you have
				access. Courses you are currently enrolled in appear
				under My Courses. Click on Course Catalog to add new
				courses to My Courses.
			</p>

			<h5>When do courses start and how long do they run?</h5>
			<p>
				All of the course start dates and duration are located
				on that course’s specific info page located on the
				Janux homepage and inside the platform. Janux courses
				run in parallel with actual OU courses and tend to
				last 16 weeks (the length of a traditional academic
				semester).
			</p>

			<h5>Do courses have prerequisites?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux courses range all the way from entry to graduate
				level and thus sometimes recommend specific
				prerequisites. All information regarding prerequisites
				can be found on the course’s specific course page
				located on the Janux homepage and inside the platform.
				If you are not interested in earning credit, you are
				not required to submit any proof of prior knowledge.
			</p>

			<h5>Do I need to be available for live video lectures?</h5>
			<p>
				All videos are asynchronous so you can interact on
				your schedule.
			</p>

			<h5>In what time zone do courses take place?</h5>
			<p>
				All course deadlines are in Central Standard Time
				(CST). Example: Quiz 1 is due Monday at midnight CST,
				or Tuesday 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).
			</p>

			<h5>Will courses be offered more than once?</h5>
			<p>
				Yes. We plan to offer most of the courses again in
				future semesters.
			</p>

			<h5>Are the videos captioned or transcribed?</h5>
			<p>
				All videos should have full transcriptions. Learn more
				about the “Play With Transcript” feature below.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I access a course if it has already started?</h5>
			<p>
				All courses can be accessed at any point during the
				courses duration. You can also access previous courses
				in the Archive section of the library.
			</p>

			<h5>Do I lose all my work at the end of the course?</h5>
			<p>
				No. As long as you have an active account, you will
				have access to all of the course materials as well as
				your notes.
			</p>

			<h5>What if I cannot finish my course?</h5>
			<p>
				There is no penalty for not completing a course. Feel
				free to come back to the course when you can. While it
				may not be running live, you will still have access to
				the course and its materials.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I remove a course from My Courses?</h5>
			<p>
				Navigate to the course catalog located in the Library
				and click on that specific course’s tile. There, you
				will see a “Drop” button which will remove the course.
			</p>



			<h3>FEATURES</h3>

			<h5>How do I make a note or highlight my text?</h5>
			<p>
				Notes can be created and attached to all types of
				content. For text, select the desired text and a
				pop-up menu will appear. Then choose “Save Highlight”
				or “Add Note”. Another way to add notes to text: a
				small icon will appear when you move your cursor to
				the right of the text. Click it and start typing.
				Within video transcripts, click the add note icon to
				the right of the transcript at the desired location.
				For images and other elements, click “Comment,”
				located on the bottom-left of the element. Each type
				of content has a way to create and share, if desired,
				your notes.
			</p>

			<h5>How can I share a note?</h5>
			<p>
				When creating a note, you have the option to make it
				“Public” or “Private.” Additionally you can tag
				individual contacts and groups in the field marked
				“Add people to this discussion.” You can also change
				the sharing once a note has been created by opening
				the note, and clicking “Share.”
			</p>

			<h5>Can everyone see the post I just made?</h5>
			<p>
				You control who is able to see your note: what you
				want, with whom you want, and when you want. Public
				notes can be viewed by everyone who has signed up for
				the course, both OU students and individuals not
				taking it for credit. If you want to keep your note to
				yourself or a limited audience, set the sharing to
				“Private” when creating the note and then tag any
				desired contacts or groups in the note.
			</p>

			<h5>How can I see the video transcripts?</h5>
			<p>
				If a video has a transcript available, there will be a
				“Play With Transcript” button in the center play bar.
				This will launch the video with the full transcript on
				the right. You can create and share notes in the
				transcript (see FAQ “How do I make a note or highlight
				my text?”)
			</p>

			<h5>How do I add a contact?</h5>
			<p>
				Add contacts to build your learning network. Click the
				Contacts tab at the top of the screen and begin typing
				the person’s name in the search bar located in the
				bottom left-hand corner of the browser. Hover your
				mouse over the desired name and click “Add Contact.”
			</p>

			<h5>How do I create and join groups?</h5>
			<p>
				From the Contacts tab, click “Groups.” In the bottom
				left-hand corner, select either “Join Group” or
				“Create Group.” To join an existing group, enter the
				Group Code and click submit. To create a new group,
				enter the name of your group and share the Group Code
				with your network. You can retrieve the Group Code at
				any time from the drop-down menu to the right of the
				group’s name.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I make a blog post?</h5>
			<p>
				On Janux, blog-style posts are called Thoughts, which
				are tied to you individually. Navigate to your profile
				by clicking your image located in the top right-hand
				corner of the browser and click “Thoughts.” Thoughts
				can be shared the same way as notes. View other
				contacts’ Thoughts by navigating to their profiles.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I find the interactive whiteboard?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux’s whiteboard tool allows you to mark up images
				and illustrate concepts. When creating a note, adding
				a comment, or chatting with a contact, click the
				“Create a Whiteboard” icon located at the bottom of
				the editor to open the whiteboard editor. Use
				whiteboards as a free-form illustration tool or to
				insert and mark up images.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I chat with my contacts?</h5>
			<p>
				Open the chat menu located in the upper right-hand
				corner to view which contacts you can chat with.
				Select the desired contact to begin chatting. Your
				contact will be notified by an indicator near the chat
				icon at the top. Start a group chat by entering
				multiple contacts’ names in the field at the bottom of
				the chat menu. Chat transcripts are stored in and can
				be accessed from your personal activity.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I search all of my notes?</h5>
			<p>
				You can search everything at once, including notes,
				content, transcripts, and more. Click the Search tab
				at the top of your browser and begin typing your
				search query. Results are sorted by type. Click “Show
				more...” to display more of that type of result. You
				can filter results by using the drop-down menu located
				on the right-hand side of the search entry field.
				Note: Janux searches for only the content located in
				the course you’re currently viewing.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I view my personal activity?</h5>
			<p>
				You can view your most recent social interactions from
				the right-hand panel or from your profile. While
				viewing the Recent Activity, filter to “Only Me” from
				the menu at the bottom. Click on your profile image in
				top right corner to open your profile. Then select the
				“Recent Activity” option. Select any of these
				interactions to open them.
			</p>

			<h5>What are Practice Questions?</h5>
			<p>
				Practice Questions allow you to check your
				understanding to make sure you fully understand
				learning concepts. You can attempt any Practice
				Question as many times as you like. Results are
				displayed in the quiz scoreboard along with the option
				to review past attempts. Practice Question results are
				not shared with your network. Certain questions may
				also contain hints and detailed solutions to aid in
				your understanding.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I update my profile information?</h5>
			<p>
				The profile shows your public information, personal
				activity, and Thoughts. Click your profile image in
				the upper right-hand corner to open your profile.
				Click the “Edit” button to change your profile image
				and update your profile information. Your email is not
				viewable to anyone else. All other information is
				publicly viewable.
			</p>

				is not permitted.
