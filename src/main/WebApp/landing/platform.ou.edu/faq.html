			<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>

			<h5>What is Janux?</h5>
			<p>
				Created by the University of Oklahoma (OU), Janux is
				an online interactive learning community that gives
				students direct connections to courses, educational
				resources, faculty, and each other. We believe students learn
				best when interacting in meaningful ways with other
				learners versus working alone in a course. Janux is
				designed to connect people while they learn from top
				OU faculty and content.
			</p>

			<h5>Who created the Janux courses?</h5>
			<p>
				All Janux courses are developed by faculty at the
				University of Oklahoma, with pedagogical and
				instructional design support from
				OU&rsquo;s <a href="http://teach.ou.edu">Center for Teaching
				Excellence</a>. Janux is a part
				of <a href="http://www.ou.edu/oneuniversity">One
				University</a>, a university-wide digital initiative,
				using technology and digital content to enhance
				the student experience.
			</p>

			<h5>What technology does Janux use?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux is built on the NextThought platform. Learn more
				about the
				technology <a href="http://nextthought.com/">here</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>Who can take a Janux course?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux courses are available to anyone! Most courses have a for-credit option and a version that anyone can take just for fun. Click on a course to find out more.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I sign up?</h5>
			<p>
				To create an account, <a href="https://janux.ou.edu/login/signup.html">click here</a>.
			</p>

			<h5>How much do courses cost?</h5>
			<p>
				All courses on Janux have been developed to offer high levels of
				academic and production quality. Some
				courses are offered for free to participants who do
				not receive credit, while some premium courses are
				available at a low cost for the non-credit option.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I earn college credit?</h5>
			<p>
				Yes. OU students can earn credit for Janux courses.
				Some premium courses are available at a low cost to the public for credit.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I just audit a course?</h5>
			<p>
				Many courses can be taken as open courses without cost.
				Some premium courses are offered at a competitive price for the non-credit option.
			</p>


			<h3>COURSES</h3>

			<h5>How do I access a course?</h5>
			<p>
				To access a course, navigate to your Library.
				Your courses will be listed under the heading &ldquo;Courses.&ldquo;
				If you are enrolled in more than four courses,
				view all your courses by selecting &ldquo;See All&ldquo;
				to the far right of the &ldquo;Courses&ldquo; heading.
				Select a course to view and participate in it.

			</p>

			<h5>When do courses start and how long do they run?</h5>
			<p>
				All of the course start dates and duration are located
				on that course&rsquo;s specific info page located on the
				Janux homepage and inside the platform. Janux courses
				run in parallel with actual OU courses and typically
				last 16 weeks (the length of a traditional academic
				semester).
			</p>

			<h5>Do courses have prerequisites?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux courses range all the way from lower division to graduate
				level and thus sometimes recommend specific
				prerequisites. All information regarding prerequisites
				can be found on the course&rsquo;s specific course page
				located on the Janux homepage and inside the platform.
				If you are not interested in earning credit, you are
				not required to submit any proof of prior knowledge.
			</p>

			<h5>Do I need to be available for live video lectures?</h5>
			<p>
				All videos are asynchronous so you can interact on
				your schedule.
			</p>

			<h5>In what time zone do courses take place?</h5>
			<p>
				All course deadlines are in Central Standard Time
				(CST). Example: Quiz 1 is due Monday at midnight CST,
				or Tuesday 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST).
				Otherwise, content can be accessed at any time.
			</p>

			<h5>Will courses be offered more than once?</h5>
			<p>
				Yes. We plan to offer most of the courses again in
				future semesters.
			</p>

			<h5>Are the videos captioned or transcribed?</h5>
			<p>
				All videos should have full transcriptions. Learn more
				about the &ldquo;Play With Transcript&rdquo; feature below.
			</p>

			<h5>Can I access a course if it has already started?</h5>
			<p>
				Most open courses can be accessed at any point during their
				duration. You can also access previous courses
				in the Archive section of the library.
			</p>

			<h5>Do I lose all my work at the end of the course?</h5>
			<p>
				No. As long as you have an active account, you will
				have access to all of the course materials as well as
				your notes.
			</p>

			<h5>What if I cannot finish my course?</h5>
			<p>
				There is no penalty for not completing a course that is not being taken for credit.
				Feel free to come back to the course when you can. While it
				may not be running live, you will still have access to
				the course and its materials.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I remove a course from My Courses?</h5>
			<p>
				In the Library, select &ldquo;+Add.&ldquo; Click the course tile for the course you want to drop.
				Select &ldquo;Drop course&ldquo; and then "Finished" to return to your library.
				Please note: if you are enrolled for college credit through a university,
				you will also need to drop the course through the university.
			</p>



			<h3>FEATURES</h3>

			<h5>How do I make a note or highlight my text?</h5>
			<p>
				Drag your cursor over the desired passage, and a
				toolbar with blue, green, and yellow circles and a
				speech bubble icon will appear. Choose a color for
				your highlighted text and you&rsquo;re done.
			<br><br>
				To make a note in text, repeat the aforementioned
				steps and select the speech bubble icon. Edit your
				title, body text, sharing and privacy settings and
				click &ldquo;Save.&rdquo; You can also create notes by clicking on
				the speech bubble icon that appears to the right of
				text on the platform, or to the right of transcripts
				if you are in the Media Viewer.
			</p>


			<h5>How can I share a note?</h5>
			<p>
				When creating a note, you have the option to share it publicly or keep it private.
				Many courses have a default share setting that shares your note with your classmates
				within the course. (In order to keep your note private,
				remove any individuals, lists, groups, or communities tagged.)
				To share a note, begin typing the name of the individual,
				list, group, or community in the sharing field
				and select them from the suggestions that appear.
				You can also change who you’ve shared with once a note has been created
				and before anyone has commented by opening the note, and clicking &rdquo;Share.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<h5>Can everyone see the post I just made?</h5>
			<p>
				Notes can be shared publicly or you can remove any tagged individuals to make the note private.
				(Please see &rdquo;How can I share a note?&rdquo; in order to find out more about sharing.)
				Thoughts within your profile can also be shared or private.
				However, discussions within a course forum, or within a Group or Community page,
				will be shared with the audience within the given context.
				In other words, your course classmates can view posted discussions within a course forum,
				and Group or Community members can view discussions created within Group or Community pages.
			</p>

			<h5>How can I see the video transcripts?</h5>
			<p>
				If a video transcript is available, an icon is
				displayed to the right of the video title on the
				overview page. Clicking on that icon takes you into
				the Media Viewer, where the transcript is available.
				To change the appearance of the transcript on your
				screen, select a preference from the menu at the top
				of the Media Viewer page.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I add a contact?</h5>
			<p>

				of the browser and click &rdquo;View Profile.&rdquo; Within your profile, select the &rdquo;Activity&rdquo; tab
				and click within the &rdquo;Write something…&rdquo; field. This will open a new Thought.
				Thoughts can be shared the same way as notes.
				(Please see &rdquo;How can I share a note?&rdquo; in order to find out more about sharing.)
				View other contacts’ public Thoughts by navigating to their profiles.
			</p>

			<h5>How do I find the interactive whiteboard?</h5>
			<p>
				Janux&rsquo;s whiteboard tool allows you to mark up images
				and illustrate concepts. When creating a note, adding
				a comment, or chatting with a contact, click the
				&ldquo;Create a Whiteboard&rdquo; icon located at the bottom of
				the editor to open the whiteboard editor. Use

			<p>
				There are three ways to start a chat with someone.

				This panel is to the right side of the screen under your profile image.

				Second, you can start a chat with an online contact from your Contacts page.
